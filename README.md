#### I'm gonna miss it. 
This routine of studying js, python and go, servers and networks, etc. was a really fun one. But if I'm serious about my future, I must study other things before focusing on programming. When I come back, I'll be better than ever. Until then, this account is as good as dead.

This change of pace is also a good chance to take better care of myself and my mental health. Seems like staying alone in the same room studying servers, networks, algorithms and programming languages the whole day, everyday, for months straight, without ever taking a break is not a textbook example of a healthy person.

*Coming back someday, Mahzze*
